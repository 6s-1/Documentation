# Introduction

HARDWARIO CHESTER is the most configurable Industrial IoT Gateway for Industry 4.0, smart city, remote metering, and agricultural applications.

CHESTER connects sensors, actuators, PLC controllers, and other devices to the internet. Flexible power supply and LPWAN communication technologies enable reliable connectivity from distant and deep indoor places.

The device features a robust, waterproof, IP67-rated enclosure to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its wide operating temperature range makes CHESTER suitable for use in demanding outdoor projects.

There are three LPWAN connectivity options. The first two provide cellular connectivity via NB-IoT and LTE-M networks with the support of a nano-SIM or an embedded SIM chip. The third option is LoRaWAN allowing operation in both private and public LoRaWAN networks. Choose the built-in internal antenna or connect an external antenna for any of those options. For diagnostics, parametrization, and device firmware upgrades, CHESTER comes with a Bluetooth Low Energy interface available in modern smart devices and notebooks.

CHESTER has been designed from the ground up as a low-power device and provides years of operation from the primary lithium cells.

Another way to power the device is to use a rechargeable battery backup module with the optional solar photovoltaic panel input. For applications where batteries are not applicable, it is possible to energize the device from a standard 24 V DC line power or 230 V AC line.

The device integrates status LED, thermometer, accelerometer, 8 MB flash memory for data logging, and 1-Wire bus, allowing connection of multiple addressable devices on a single cable.

The optional GNSS module supporting GPS, Galileo, and GLONASS satellite systems, provides accurate tracking capability for mobile outdoor applications. In addition, location tracking can be used in a low-duty cycle, battery-friendly mode of operation.

CHESTER is easily extensible with accessories like an external temperature and humidity sensor, battery pack, illuminated push-button, and tamper switch. Together with the extensive set of push-in terminals, the wiring of external interfaces is fast and easy.

The product is compatible with various industrial sensors - RTD thermometers, thermocouples, capacitive, inductive, optical, hall switches, and many other sensors.

For example, CHESTER can read digital inputs, talk to Modbus RS-485 devices, and measure analog inputs. As a result, it can get data from sensors like pressure, flow, weight, distance, and other physical quantities.

There is also a possibility to read indoor air quality data, such as temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, and dust. Also, CHESTER can detect events like motion, via a PIR detector or tilt, through the integrated accelerometer.

In addition, the illuminated push-button device variant provides notifications on a button press with optical and acoustic feedback.

The number of hardware integrations constantly evolves, and we listen to our customer demands. As the device flexibility is enormous, we customize the product assemblies for each project to match the target applications perfectly.

Our partners use CHESTER firmware SDK to create their applications through the simple API without the need for a comprehensive understanding of embedded system programming.

With the SDK and many examples, customers can create their custom Internet-of-Things applications in a matter of days, not months. The SDK core builds on top of the innovative Zephyr OS - a real-time operating system backed by the Linux Foundation project with a strong emphasis on security. CHESTER can connect to HARDWARIO Cloud and send or receive some data from it. The customer's responsibility is as trivial as a REST API call or a webhook notification to their HTTP endpoint.

The product comes in two business models: Hardware-as-a-Service, where regular monthly fees are applied, and a one-time purchase at full cost. We will provide you with the pricing details upon request. On top of that, we provide full OEM branding service, including custom color printing on the enclosure (e.g., for your company logo).
