# Catalog Applications

This article provides information on the so-called **catalog application** for the **CHESTER** platform.

**CHESTER** is an extensible low-power IoT gateway with an open SDK built on top of the **Zephyr** operating system. For immediate deployment, **HARDWARIO** provides several applications for particular use cases. Those **catalog applications** are available from **HARDWARIO** with a short lead time. The applications have source codes available as part of the **CHESTER SDK** and are actively improved, maintained, and supported.

The **catalog applications** also serve as a great starting point for your own firmware application.

## Application List

The table below provides an overview of the available catalog applications:
