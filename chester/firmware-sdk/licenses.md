# Licenses

In this article, you will find useful information about the **CHESTER SDK** license.

:::caution

The following text is modified content from the **nRF Connect SDK** and fully applies to the **CHESTER SDK**.

:::

Licenses are located close to the source files. You can find a `LICENSE` file containing the license details at the top of every **CHESTER SDK** repository. Each file included in the repositories also has an [**SPDX identifier**](https://spdx.dev/ids/) that mentions this license.

If a folder or set of files is open source and included in the **nRF Connect SDK** under its own license (for example, any of the **Apache** or **MIT** licenses), it will have either its own `LICENSE` file included in the folder or the license information embedded inside the source files themselves.

You can use the **West** utility `ncs-sbom` (provided by the **nRF Connect SDK**) to generate a license report. It allows you to generate a report for the **CHESTER SDK**, built application, or specific files. The tool is highly configurable. It uses several detection methods, such as:

* Search based on **SPDX** tags.

* Search license information in files.

* The [**Scancode-Toolkit**](https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Depending on your configuration, the report is generated in **HTML** or **SPDX**, or in both formats. See the [**Software Bill of Materials**](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/scripts/west_commands/sbom/README.html#west-sbom) documentation for more information.
